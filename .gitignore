#this is the git ignore file if you want to use the free Unity 
# the ! negates an ignore, so you ignore everything in Library then
#un-ignore the metadata folder and those specific files
#use at your own risk.

#NOTE: this will cause your collaborators to re-import assets
# (previews and cache), but it seems to have no value to keep in source control
